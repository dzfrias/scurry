# Code Style
This section goes over the preferred code style in Scurry.

## Rules
- Indents should be 4 spaces
- Left curly braces should never be on their own line
   ```
   // Prefer this
   if True {
      // ...
   }

   // Over this
   if True
   {
      // ...
   }
   ```
- Lines should aim to be no more than 80 characters in length
- Variables should be in snake_case
- Functions should be in snake_case
- Imported files should be in snake_case
- Components should be in UpperCamelCase
- Comments should preferably be on their own line
- Inline comments should be two spaces away from the line they comment
- Function calls should have spaces between arguments
- Function argument lists should have spaces between arguments

Everything else should be treated as personal preference!
