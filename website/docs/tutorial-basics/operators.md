# Basic Operators

Operators in Scurry are plain and simple.

```
>> 1 + 1;
2

>> 2.3 - 1;
0

>> 20 / 5;
4

>> 8 * 8;
64

>> 20 % 2;
0

>> 4 == 4;
True

>> 3 != "hello";
True

>> !True;
False

>> True && False;
False

>> True || False;
True
```
Everything else you might expect is similarly standard.

See the [builtin types](../category/types) for a more in-depth look into each
operator.
